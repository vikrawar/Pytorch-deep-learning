# Deep Neural Network with PyTorch 
This notebook transitions from manual NumPy neural network implementations to the powerful PyTorch deep learning framework.

---

## üîç What's Inside
* Low-Level PyTorch Implementation: Building the deep NN using torch.Tensor operations, manual forward passes, and PyTorch's autograd for backpropagation.
* Explicit Mapping: Clear comments and markdown explaining how PyTorch tensor operations and autograd correspond to our previous NumPy code.
* High-Level PyTorch Implementation: Re-implementing the same network using nn.Module, nn.Linear layers, and built-in optimizers for a more abstracted and efficient approach.
* He Initialization: Proper weight initialization for ReLU layers in both low-level and high-level PyTorch.

## üéØ Why This Project
This project serves as a bridge from foundational understanding to practical framework usage. By building a network in PyTorch using both granular tensor operations and higher-level abstractions, you gain a deeper appreciation for:
* How PyTorch manages automatic differentiation.
* The elegance and efficiency of PyTorch‚Äôs high level API for defining complex architectures.
* The seamless transition from manual gradient descent to PyTorch's optimizers.
